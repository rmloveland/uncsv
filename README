uncsv - convert CSV into a delimited format understood by UNIX tools (awk, etc.)

INTRODUCTION

Inspired by this comp.lang.awk post by Barry Fishman <barry@ecubist.org>:

    The traditional Unix way is probably to write a separate program
    uncsv to convert CVS files to simple delimited files that allow
    its default output delimiter to be changed with a -d option,
    rather than adding more complexity to awk.  If need be, there
    would also be a csv program to convert simple delimited files to
    CSV.

    The uncvs could emit warning (and have a test mode) to show if the
    selected delimiter can be used.  The default delimiter could be
    something innocuous like '|' or ISO/IEC 2022 (and Unicode)
    standard unit separator (US) code 31 (control-_).

USAGE

$ uncsv -d':' some-file.csv
# ... prints file using ':' as delimiter

$ cat some-file.csv | uncsv -d':' -
#  ... same as above, but using '-' to read from STDIN
